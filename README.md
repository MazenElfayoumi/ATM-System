# ATM System using C++
 This project is a C++ implementation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. The system allows users to perform various banking operations such as viewing their balance, withdrawing funds, depositing money, and changing their account password. The ATM system includes features like password protection, balance management, and money denomination handling.

## Features:
View Balance: Check the current account balance stored in the system.
Withdraw Money: Withdraw specific amounts, with the system ensuring the balance is sufficient and providing denominations as needed.
Deposit Money: Add funds to the account, updating the balance accordingly.
Change Password: Securely update the account password with an option for automatic password generation.
Error Handling: Alerts the user for incorrect inputs such as invalid withdrawal amounts or wrong passwords.

## Files:
balance.txt: Stores the current balance of the account.
password.txt: Contains the encrypted password for accessing the ATM system.

## Getting Started:
To compile and run the program, simply use a C++ compiler and run the executable. The system interacts with the balance and password files to simulate ATM operations.
